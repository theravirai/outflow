Read database/db.py to understand the expenses table 
schema, the db connection pattern, and the database 
file name.

User input: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1 — Parse arguments

Extract from $ARGUMENTS:
- user_id — integer
- count — integer, number of expenses to create
- months — integer, how many past months to spread them across

If any argument is missing or not a valid integer, stop and say:
"Usage: /seed-expenses <user_id> <count> <months>
Example: /seed-expenses 1 50 6"

## Step 2 — Verify user exists

Before generating anything, confirm the user_id exists 
in the users table. If not, stop and say:
"No user found with id <user_id>."

## Step 3 — Generate and insert expenses

Write and run a Python script that:

1. Spreads expenses randomly across the past <months> months
2. Uses these categories with realistic German descriptions
   and amounts (€):
   - Food: 5–80
     (Supermarket, Bakery, Restaurant, Coffee Shop)
   - Transport: 3–100
     (Deutschlandticket, Train Ticket, Fuel, Taxi)
   - Bills: 20–500
     (Internet, Electricity, Rent, Mobile Plan)
   - Health: 10–250
     (Pharmacy, Doctor Visit, Health Insurance)
   - Entertainment: 10–150
     (Cinema, Netflix, Concert, Gym Membership)
   - Shopping: 15–400
     (Clothing, Electronics, Household Items)
   - Other: 5–100
     (Gifts, Donations, Miscellaneous)
3. Distributes categories roughly proportionally 
   (Food most common, Health and Entertainment least)
4. Uses the db connection pattern from db.py — do not 
   hardcode the database filename
5. Uses parameterized queries only — no string formatting in SQL
6. Inserts all expenses in a single transaction — 
   roll back everything if any insert fails

## Step 4 — Confirm

Print:
- How many expenses were inserted
- The date range they span
- A sample of 5 inserted records
